Bird101 Java Classes
This Java project includes a bird hierarchy with an abstract class, Bird101, and an interface, Flyable. Two concrete classes, Pigeon and Penguin, showcase inheritance. While both inherit the abstract class, Penguin solely relies on it, emphasizing non-flying characteristics. Pigeon implements the Flyable interface, reflecting its airborne nature. This design enables flexibility in accommodating diverse avian behaviors within the codebase. Explore the classes for a comprehensive understanding of avian traits and behaviors in a simplified Java implementation.
